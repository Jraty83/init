NAT server 10.60.1.1

#Network Address Translation (NAT) servers are the (automatic) mail guys of Internet
#data traffic.

#When you connect some device to a local network, a NAT server with its own external
#address steps in, and acts like everyone under its responsibility has the same address
#externally, but gives different addresses to all the devices it is working on behalf
#of internally.

#Your global address appears to be something else to everyone outside of your local
#network, and a NAT server is sorting out where to redirect your Internet traffic.
